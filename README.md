Aspect Oriented Programming with Spring
  One of the key components of Spring Framework is the Aspect oriented programming (AOP) framework. Aspect-Oriented Programming 
entails breaking down program logic into distinct parts called so-called concerns. The functions that span multiple points of 
an application are called cross-cutting concerns and these cross-cutting concerns are conceptually separate from the 
application's business logic. There are various common good examples of aspects like logging, auditing, declarative 
transactions, security, caching, etc.

  Spring AOP module provides interceptors to intercept an application. For example, when a method is executed, you can add 
extra functionality before or after the method execution.

  This code contains implementation of different types of advices named: 
  1.Before
  2.After
  3.AfterThrowing
  4.AfterReturning
  5.Around
